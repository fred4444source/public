					What WebAssembly is

					The problems that WebAssembly solves

					How WebAssembly works

					What makes WebAssembly secure

					The languages you can use to create a WebAssembly module

					When it comes to web development, one thing that’s top

					of mind for most web developers is performance, from

					how fast the web page loads to how responsive it is

					overall. A number of studies have shown that if your

					web page doesn’t load within three seconds, 40% of your

					visitors will leave. That percentage increases for every

					additional second it takes your page to load.

					How long it takes your web page to load isn’t the only

					issue. According to one Google article, if a web page has

					poor performance, 79% of visitors say they’re less likely

					to purchase from that website again (Daniel An and Pat

					Meenan, “Why marketers should care about mobile

					page speed” [July 2016], http://mng.bz/MOlD).

					As web technologies have advanced, there’s been a push

					to move more and more applications to the web. This

					has presented developers with another challenge,

					because web browsers support only one programming

					language: JavaScript.

					Having a single programming language across all

					browsers is good in one sense—you only have to write

					your code once, and you know that it will run in every

					browser. You still have to test in each browser you

					intend to support, because vendors sometimes

					implement things slightly differently. Also, sometimes

					one browser vendor won’t add a new feature at the same

					time other vendors do. Overall, though, having one

					language to support is easier than having four or five.

					The downside of browsers supporting only JavaScript,

					however, is that the applications we want to move to the

					web aren’t written in JavaScript—rather, they’re written

					in languages like C++.

					JavaScript is a great programming language, but we’re

					now asking it to do more than it was originally designed

					to do—heavy computations for games, for example—and

					we’re asking it to run really fast.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a browser has compiled the WebAssembly bytecode into machine code, the compiled module can be passed to a web worker (we’ll dig into web workers in chapter 9, but, for now, know that web workers are a way to create threads in JavaScript) or to another browser window. The compiled module can even be used to create additional instances of the module.
				</div>
				<br/>
				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;一但浏览器编译WebAssembly字节码为机器码, 编译后的模块 能够传输给web worker(我们挖掘web worker在第9章，但是，现在在javascript中web workers是创建线程的一种方法)或者另一个浏览器窗口。编译好的模块甚至能够用来创建额外的模块实例。

					1.4.1. Preamble
					<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble contains a magic number (0x00 0x61 0x73 0x6D, which is \0asm) that distinguishes a WebAssembly module from an ES6 module. This magic number is then followed by a version (0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00, which is 1) that indicates which version of the WebAssembly binary format was used to create the file.
					<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one version of the binary format exists at the moment. One of the goals with WebAssembly is to keep everything backward-compatible as new features are being added and to avoid having to increase the version number. If a feature ever arises that can’t be implemented without breaking things, then the version number will be increased.

					1.6. How is WebAssembly secure?
					<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way that WebAssembly is secure is that it’s the first language to ever share the JavaScript VM, which is sandboxed from the runtime and has had years of hardening and security tests to make it secure. WebAssembly modules don’t have access to anything that JavaScript doesn’t have access to and will also respect the same security policies, which include enforcing things like same-origin policy.
